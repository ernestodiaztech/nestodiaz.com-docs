# 1. Cluster Topology

The Cluster Topology shown in Figure 1 illustrates the top-level layout of the Infrastructure Management Cluster. The cluster’s layout generally consists of virtualized systems that host web applications or infrastructure services, and bare-metal systems where high-demand computational workloads are performed. While it is possible to virtualize all systems, bare-metal nodes are recommended for workloads with significant computational or I/O requirements.

A properly configured DNS server that provides a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for each system, or alternatively a hosts file that defines the FQDN, is required. Some services (e.g., FreeIPA/IdM) will not function properly without FQDN hostnames being defined.

These guides only cover a simple network and do not address redundant network interfaces, which are recommended for production environments.

## Operating Systems

These guides are written for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8–based operating systems and are compatible with AlmaLinux 8 and Rocky Linux 8. Any OS-specific differences are noted where required.

## Hostnames

These guides use the following hostname and IPv4 address mappings as examples, which should be adapted for your production environment.

Here's an example /etc/hosts file.

```bash title="hosts"
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
